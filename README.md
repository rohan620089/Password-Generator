# Password-Generator
* Exciting Milestone: I Built a Python Password Generator during my CodSoft Internship!

I am thrilled to share a project I recently completed during my internship at CodSoft feature-rich Password Generator built using Python and cutomtkinter , pyperclip python librarie. This project not only helped me deepen my programming skills but also gave me hands-on experience with creating user-friendly applications.

*Key Features:*

- *Basic Operations:* Generate Password between 6 to 30 char using slider and also copy to use that password anywhere

- *User Interface:* Intuitive and clean design making it easy to use.
